## Try it out!

You can try CoCast directly at [https://printfer.github.io/cocast/](https://printfer.github.io/cocast/), or you can build the project yourself. To build the project, you'll need to have `npm` installed on your machine. Once you have that, simply clone [this repository](https://github.com/printfer/cocast) and run the following command:

```
npm install
npm run build
npm run preview
```

This will launch the CoCast application in your default web browser. From there, you can invite your friends and start watching videos together. You can also find a production-ready build in the `dist` directory.

## Q&A

### Why doesn't the media pause when another peer is still loading the video?

This behavior is intentional. Although it may be inconvenient for the media to continue playing while other peers are still loading the video, pausing the other party's media progress when loading, especially when the loading process happens frequently, might negatively impact the user experience. Currently, there are no good solutions to solve this, so CoCast remains to provide basic functions. Suggestions for improving this feature are welcome as further improvements are necessary.

### Why doesn't CoCast have a built-in chat system?

CoCast is designed exclusively for media casting and does not include additional features such as chat. In addition, CoCast is a serverless application that relies on WebRTC for peer-to-peer communication. While WebRTC is more secure than other alternatives, it still presents certain [security and privacy concerns](https://webrtc-security.github.io/) that must be addressed. Creating a chat system within WebRTC would require additional work to ensure privacy and security are adequately addressed. Therefore, it is recommended that users utilize their favorite messaging tools instead.
